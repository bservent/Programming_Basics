/* ANALYZING ALGORITHMS */

/* INTRO TO TIME COMPLEXITY */

/* Time complexity is a standard way of analyzing and comparing different algorithms */

/* n-NOTATION */

/* n is a function of n
output is a function of input
ex: algorithm takes in n num of fb friends and outputs n^2 (inefficient function)
What's the point of n?
  -allows us to see how an algorithm scales with input size
    -if we design an algorithm, we want to know, we want to know, is it efficient with more people and input? 
    -We want our programs to succeed, so we want to make solutions which scale.
    -is the algorithm scalable */

/* n-NOTATION SCALING GOALS */

/* Goals
-We are looking for large patterns
-We want to see major efficiency changes btw diff algorithms 

Rules
-We don't care about multiples ex: n^2 = 2n^2
-We take the largest in an equation*/

/* BIG O NOTATION */

/* big O represents a boundry
a program is dictated by it's worst comoponent 
big O represents equal to or faster when consider in an algorithm */
